The goal is to:
Predict the machine's condition (cooler, valve, leakage, pressure, stability) based on sensor readings.
Monitor system health by identifying anomalies in real-time or pre-emptively detecting failures.


Potential tasks:

a. Classification: 
Predict classes for conditions (e.g., cooler condition %, valve condition %, etc.).

b. Regression: 
Predict continuous degradation trends (e.g., efficiency factor).

c. Anomaly Detection: 
Identify anomalies that deviate from normal behavior.

d. Condition Monitoring: 
Use models to classify or forecast degradation trends over time.
